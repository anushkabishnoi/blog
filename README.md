# blog
Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹
This is a blog website made using: 

- LAMP stack
- PHP used as frontend with some CSS and JS for styling
- MySQL used as backend, with Apache server

Some cool features:
- add/delete posts
- admin privileges
    - featured post
    - delete others' posts
    - cool admin dashboard
- login/logout
- only home page visible to guest users (not signed up yet)

  Sadly I can't figure out hosting just yet, so no preview available :(
